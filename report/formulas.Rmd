$$\mu_{HP-LP}=\mu_{HP}-\mu_{LP}$$


$$\sigma_{HP-LP}=\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_{HP}^2+\sigma^2_{LP}}{2}}$$


$$p(\theta)=\sum_{i=1}^K \phi_i \mathcal{N}(\mu_i$$

whereas K is the number of normal distributions, i.e. 2 for the separation of vegetative cells and spores in individual channels.

In its most general implementation, a predefined number $k$ of cluster centroids $\{\mu_1,\mu_2,...,\mu_k}$ is randomly distributed in the feature space.
Each observation $\{x_1,x_2,...,x_n\}$ is then assigned to each closest centroid:
$$x_i:=argmin ||x_i-\mu_j||$$
